# Token-Based Voting System

A decentralized blockchain voting platform built with smart contracts to ensure secure, transparent, and tamper-proof governance processes.

## 🗳️ Overview

This project implements a token-based voting system that leverages blockchain technology to create a trustless and verifiable voting mechanism. Voters use governance tokens to participate in proposals, with all transactions recorded immutably on the blockchain.

## ✨ Features

- **Token-Based Governance**: Vote weight determined by token holdings
- **Smart Contract Security**: Automated execution with built-in safeguards  
- **Transparent Results**: All votes publicly verifiable on blockchain
- **Decentralized Architecture**: No single point of failure
- **Proposal Management**: Create, track, and execute governance proposals
- **Anti-Double Voting**: Built-in mechanisms to prevent duplicate voting
- **Time-Bound Voting**: Configurable voting periods for each proposal

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Solidity** - Smart contract development
- **Hardhat** - Ethereum development environment
- **OpenZeppelin** - Secure smart contract libraries
- **JavaScript** - Testing and deployment scripts
- **Ethers.js** - Ethereum library for blockchain interaction

## 📋 Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet
- Basic understanding of blockchain and smart contracts
